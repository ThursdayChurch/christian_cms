=== What is this? ===

This is a very simple Restfull CMS application written in Ruby on Rails 2.2.2
It was made for my local church and I decided to make it public. 
Patches and comments are welcome.


=== How to get Church CMS up and running === 

Required Gems:
	'will_paginate'
	'fastercsv'
	'mini_magick'
  'redcloth'
  'feed_tools'
  'json'
  'memcache-client' (for production session storage)
  

=== Memcached: === 
  you can disable memcached in environments/production.rb


===  Instructions: === 

Quick Setup (currently for non-Windows users only - due to ferret gem issues):

  1. Create the database
  2. Copy and Edit config/database.yml.sample to config/database.yml
	3. Edit config/initializers/settings.rb
	4. rake db:migrate
	5. ruby script/server
